campsass-site
=============

Site for the one-day, one-track Sass conference in San Francisco.

To run the site locally, use [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). It's super-easy to get started – just run

    gem install middleman

Then, in the campsass-site directory, just run "middleman". Go to http://localhost:4567 and you'll have the CampSass site!

Feel free to send pull requests with fixes to stuff.
